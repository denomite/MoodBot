## Project description

    This is simple Arduino project where i load and display a sequence of animated robot emoji faces
    on an 12x8 LED matrix using Arduino UNO R4 WIFI.
    Instead of using a library like loadFrame, i manually control each pixel with a custom 2d array
    to create different robot expressions.


    ### The goal was to get hands-on practice with:
    -  Including LED_Matrix
    -  Uploading and running the code on Arduino UNO
    -  Mupltiple custom robot expressions

    ### Faces included
    - Neutral robot face
    - Right eye wink
    - Smiling robot face
    - Sleeping face
    - Sad face
    - Suprised face
